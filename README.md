## Tic Tac Toe

About the Project
------------------------
[Here is the live site](https://shelleyyz.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
This is the first game I've ever programmed and tested my skills in the below fundamentals of programming:

- Command line
- Source control
- Deployment

It's a simple two player game of TicTacToe built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the jQuery library.

The basic requirement is to have the game switch turns between X and 0 and visually displays which side won if a player gets three in a row or a draw is found. 

Bonus functionality:
- Animations including an looping gradient background
- Fade in and fade out of player icons
- Modal displaying which player has won and a restart button

Future improvements:
- Review code and make it DRYer
- LocalStorage
- Win counter
- Ability for players to customise their tokens
